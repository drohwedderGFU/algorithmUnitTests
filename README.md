Hello!

This is the unit testing repository for CSIS430. 
Unit tests will be in JUnit 4, using custom hamcrest matchers. 
Ensure you have JUnit, hamcrest-core, and hamcrest-java. 
The hamcrest .jars can be found at http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3Aorg.hamcrest 
and the junit jar can be found at http://search.maven.org/#search|gav|1|g:%22junit%22%20AND%20a:%22junit%22 
(install the latest junit4 probably, doesn't really matter [we use junit4 because it's stable, taylor])

Don't be afraid to write really long variable names, or make really long lines with lots of is() operators so that each test is left-to-right readable.

Happy testing!
